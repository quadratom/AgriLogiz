                        I have just concluded a field practical where I was
                        meant to experiment with maize and okra plants. As the
                        experiment was brought to an end, I felt great joy
                        surging through my chest as I examined my total yield.
                        Like every other farmer, the bountiful harvest
                        immediately made up for the long hours on the field. At
                        that point, I remember thinking I deserved a pat on the
                        back for a job well done. (chuckles).

                            Mr. Anonymous has rightly said “If man will but
                            learn the ways of his crop, he may have largely
                            within his grasp the power to get what he deserves
                            from the plant world. He may set certain forces in
                            action; and then, at the right moment gather a
                            harvest superior in yield and quality to that of his
                            less diligent neighbours.” The point is, a good
                            yield is the goal of every farmer. However, this is
                            not always the case especially in subsistence
                            farming.

                            The major cause of low crop yield especially in
                            Nigeria is the failure to maintain the fertility of
                            the soil. It is simple truth that the growth of all
                            cultivated plant is dependent on the soil, and the
                            yield of crops is a direct reflection of its
                            condition. The good news is, the condition of the
                            soil can be easily maintained by applying the right
                            farm inputs. Farm inputs simply refers to any
                            resource included during the farming process and
                            could include Improved seeds, fertilizers,
                            irrigation, crop protection chemicals etc.

                            Improved seed is one of the most economical and
                            efficient inputs in a farming process as the quality
                            of the seed can increase the yield potential of the
                            crop by significant folds. Improved seed varieties
                            have the various characteristics to suit different
                            ecological zones. For instance, maize varieties
                            showing the following features have been made
                            available- strong roots, good husk cover, resistance
                            to foliar diseases, tolerance to drought, tolerance
                            to Striga hermontica, tolerance to low soil nitrogen
                            etc. All of these improved features have contributed
                            greatly to the increase in yield of maize.

                            Different crops and land plots require different
                            amounts of fertilizers. Besides, not all crops
                            across the field are in the same condition. The
                            usual practice of blanket fertilizing is often
                            harmful for the future yield, as well as for the
                            local environment. Satellite soil monitoring
                            programs help farmers introduce the right amounts of
                            fertilizer and figure out the areas on the field
                            which require lower or higher levels of
                            fertilization.

                            Irrigation is the agricultural process of applying
                            controlled amounts of water to the soil. It
                            increases water content in the root layer in order
                            to increase soil fertility by acting as a solvent
                            for the nutrients to be dissolved in. However, some
                            plants prefer dry soil; do bear this in mind before
                            applying irrigation. Irrigation helps to increase
                            microbial decomposition of organic manure to release
                            nutrients for crop plant, suppress weed growth and
                            prevent soil consolidation. It is not just enough to
                            apply water to the soil, the amount of water
                            required, rate and frequency of watering are
                            important aspects to consider. Traditionally, water
                            for irrigation can be gotten from dams, lakes,
                            rivers, wells, ponds, reservoirs among other
                            sources. Here are some irrigation systems to
                            consider: Surface irrigation, Subsurface irrigation,
                            Drip irrigation, Sprinkler irrigation and Flood
                            irrigation.

                            showed that farmers who adopted the use of improved
                            maize seed had a yield of 2,713.66kg/ha compared to
                            the yield of 1,281.33kg/ha for local maize variety.

                        <div>
                            A recent study showed that grain yield was increased
                            by 32% in the semi-arid zones of Nigeria through the
                            use of Nitrogen fertilizers.

                        <div>
                            In 2017, studies showed that irrigation increased
                            crop yield by 507.09kg/ha. The FAO has estimated
                            pre-harvest crop losses due to weed infestation,
                            plant diseases; arthropods (largely insects and
                            termites) to be around 30% to 35% and post-harvest
                            losses (grain storage etc.) amounted to an
                            additional 10-20%.

                            improve crop yield, a common mistake usually made by
                            farmers is acquiring these materials from open
                            market sources. It is worthy of note that seeds,

                            markets are sometimes not viable and without
                            potency. It is safer to purchase seeds and chemicals
                            from the Agricultural Development Project (ADP) or
                            the Ministry of Agriculture in your state and from
                            reputable dealers within the locality.

                            More often than not farmers assume that the reason
                            they have low crop yield is because of the soil
                            type. However, yield is more dependent on variety,
                            husbandry and the use of fertilizer all of which
                            combines to maintain the condition of the soil.
                            Another salient reason for losses is delayed
                            harvesting as it prolongs crop exposure to pest
                            infestation.

                            farmers will produce more crops with higher
