                        Agriculture forms the basis of the world's food supply.
                        Soil conditions, water availability, weather extremes
                        and climate change can represent costly challenges both
                        to farmers and the overall food security of populations.

                            Satellite technology is of value to farmers,
                            agronomists, food manufacturers and agricultural
                            policymakers who wish to simultaneously enhance
                            production and profitability. Remote sensing
                            satellites provide key data for monitoring soil,
                            snow cover, drought and crop development. Rainfall
                            assessments from satellites, for example, help
                            farmers plan the timing and amount of irrigation
                            they will need for their crops. Accurate information
                            and analysis can also help predict a region's
                            agricultural output well in advance and can be
                            critical in anticipating and mitigating the effects
                            of food shortages and famines.

                            The role that space-based technologies play in
                            agriculture is overwhelming and massive, this is
                            owing to the fact that space technologies uses a
                            como of emerging technologies like big data,
                            internet of things, Artificial Intelligence and
                            cloud computing to provide precision to agriculture.
                            The following are roles of the space technology on
                            our agriculture;

                        <div>
                            Soil condition monitoring is very much like crop
                            health monitoring. Same way as vegetation, soil can
                            reveal a variety of states in the form of normal,
                            dehydrated, or overhydrated plots unevenly
                            distributed over the farmland due to surface
                            topography. The accurate and well-visualized data of
                            moisture distribution over the farmland means a lot
                            for a farmer.

                        <div>
                            Different crops and land plots require different
                            amounts of fertilizers. Besides, not all crops
                            across the field are in the same condition. The
                            usual practice of blanket fertilizing is often
                            harmful for the future yield, as well as for the
                            local environment. Satellite soil monitoring
                            programs help farmers introduce the right amounts of
                            fertilizer and figure out the areas on the field
                            which require lower or higher levels of
                            fertilization.

                            One of the most acute issues of contemporary farmers
                            is the optimization of water, fertilizers, and
                            machinery use. The satellite data provide a
                            framework for building a real-time resource
                            management system increasing overall efficiency and
                            reducing waste. Data from satellite vision systems
                            provide farmers with insights on where and how much
                            the farmland needs water, preventing under- or
                            over-watering of soil. Blind use of water resources
                            means more than extra cost for a farmer, but it can
                            also negatively impact the environment and wider
