                        When you hear the word "agriculture" what comes to mind?
                        Rural dwellers tilling the ground with hoe and cutlass?
                        In the past you would have been right but presently
                        agriculture has evolved beyond the cultivation of crops
                        with the use of crude tools. Crops are no longer
                        produced for self-sustenance or exchange but for
                        commercial purposes. The production of crops is not
                        complete until the produced crops get to the hands of
                        the consumers and that is where agricultural marketing
                        comes into play.

                            Agricultural marketing is the stage in agricultural
                            production where the crops so produced get to the
                            ultimate consumer. Previously, it would have meant
                            farmers displaying their wares at the local market
                            and running the risk of all their produce not
                            getting sold which will eventually lead to waste
                            and/or loss. But with advances in the technological
                            landscape, farmers can now utilize modern technology
                            - social media, blogs, etc. - to promote their
                            products and further increase their reach and
                            sales.

                              - Who's your target audience?: Does that sound
                            familiar? I guess so. The question of the target
                            audience is not just limited to businesses that deal
                            in services but to every individual or organization
                            that renders goods and services to others. You're a
                            farmer which means that you have farm produce for
                            sale, so, who are your ideal buyers? Who are you
                            targeting? Are your produce geared towards people of
                            a particular ethnic group? A particular gender, age
                            range, or income level? A horse farmer would be more
                            inclined to target male clientele with high income.
                            Are your products needed by people in a particular
                            location? For instance, if you're a pig farmer
                            located in the northern states of Nigeria, it is
                            safe to assume that most of your clients would
                            majorly be located in non-northern states. Knowing
                            your target audience would help you tailor your
                            marketing strategy to their desires and needs; it
                            would help you speak to their pain points and show
                            you off as a business that really gets them. Do note
                            that if your farm happens to be involved in the
                            production of different produce, you'll have to
                            tailor your marketing efforts to their specific
                            audiences.

                              - Distinguish yourself from the crowd: A farm like
                            any other business needs a unique selling
                            proposition. What makes your farm different from
                            those around you? Just like when you think
                            refreshment and Coca-Cola comes to mind, you've got
                            to think of the feeling, thought, or vibe you'll
                            like your customers to sense around you. Why should
                            anyone purchase from you instead of your
                            competitors? Are your produce organic? Are they
                            fresh? Do you offer excellent customer service and
                            quick delivery? Do you use a particular production
                            method that's considered healthier and preferable?
                            If your answer to that question and the rest is
                            "yes" then you definitely need to use it in crafting
                            your USP. Your USP should be brief, clear and
                            simple. It should state the benefits your customers
                            stand to enjoy when they do business with you. A
                            well crafted USP will serve as a compass and keep
                            you on path no matter the situation around you.

                              - Branding: When you hear brand, the first thing
                            that likely comes to mind is a logo; that is part of
                            what makes your brand but not entirely. Branding
                            refers to your logo, the fonts you use, everything
                            that makes you you. It refers to everything that
                            shapes who you are as a business and how you
                            interact with your consumers. It influences how your
                            consumers see you. Effective branding encompasses
                            your vision, mission, production and production
                            facilities as well as life on the farm. It sells
                            your consumers on who you are, your personality and
                            your passions. It tells them what to feel around you
                            and gives them something to associate your products
                            with. If you're into organic crops, then gear your
                            branding towards that so that when consumers see
                            your product, they'll associate it with natural
                            food. Proper branding also gives you an edge in the
                            market place and help build consumer loyalty. It
                            further influences how the industry is perceived by
                            consumers and how its participants feel. For
                            instance, people involved in the production process
                            of a particular brand have a sense of pride at being
                            associated with a reputable brand. All the above
                            benefits will culminate in an increased patronage.

                              - Utilize data-driven marketing: Social media
                            platforms such as Instagram and Facebook can be used
                            in your marketing campaign. They can be used to put
                            up ads targeted at your particular audience using
                            the data gotten. With these platforms, the ads can
                            be tailored specifically to your target audience
                            wherever they may be located and to the tiniest
                            detail. Email marketing could also be employed as
                            well as Google ads. One thing to bear in mind when
                            doing this is to ensure consistency in message and
                            tone. It helps build familiarity when they come
                            across your ads on a site and afterwards recognise
                            the message and tone from an email received. It
                            makes them trust you enough to want to know what
                            you're about.

                              - Attendance at farm-related events: Be it a
                            seminar, fair, festival, or farmer's market, such
                            events give you an opportunity to physically
                            interact with your consumers and help them put a
                            face to the name they're already familiar with.
                            Asides that, it further exposes you to a new market
                            which you've previously been unable to reach via
                            digital marketing. You'll want to be deliberate
                            about the events you showcase your products at.
                            You'll want to pick events with an audience that's
                            interested in your produce to increase your chances
                            of sales. Also, lots of people tend to buy on
                            impulse so ensure that your displays are really
                            attractive.

                            remember you but they'll surely remember how you
                            made them feel. Whether you're taking a call, taking
                            orders or selling, do all with the mindset of
                            offering the best service available to that
                            customer. A customer is like a blank ad space, what
                            they say is all up to you. You treat them well and
                            they'll be sure to sing your praises and come back
                            for more. This is definitely what you want; they'll
                            get you more clients and ultimately increase your
                            sales. A badly treated customer will speak ill of
                            you and ultimately ruin your business. Don't be so
                            focused on building yourself that you fail to pay
                            attention to your consumers.

                            outlined above, now is the time to step back and
                            review your progress so far. I'd recommend that this
                            be done within 6-12 months of implementing the new
                            strategies. Did you make a profit? Did your sales
                            increase and by how much? Did the implemented
                            strategy make any difference? These questions and
                            others like it should be asked at the end of the
                            marketing year. This will determine whether to
                            continue with the present plan or fine-tune it.
